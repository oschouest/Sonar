# AudioRadar-HUD Assets

This directory contains visual assets for the project:

## Screenshots Needed:

1. **radar_screenshot.png** - Main HUD showing active radar with blips
2. **config_menu.png** - Configuration interface (if implemented)  
3. **themes.png** - Comparison of dark/light themes
4. **demo.gif** - Animated demonstration of radar in action

## How to Create:

### radar_screenshot.png
1. Launch: `python real_audio_tkinter_hud.py`
2. Play audio with directional sound
3. Take screenshot showing active blips
4. Crop to show just the HUD window

### demo.gif
1. Use screen recording software (OBS, etc.)
2. Record HUD during gameplay
3. Convert to GIF (max 5MB for GitHub)
4. Show blips appearing from different directions

## Guidelines:
- Use high contrast for visibility
- Show realistic usage scenario  
- Keep file sizes reasonable for GitHub
- Ensure no sensitive game content visible
